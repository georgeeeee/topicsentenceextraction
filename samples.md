| We present new results concerning threshold functions for a wide family of random intersection graphs. To this end we apply the coupling method used for establishing threshold functions for homogeneous random intersection graphs introduced by Karo\\'nski, Scheinerman, and Singer--Cohen. In the case of inhomogeneous random intersection graphs the method has to be considerably modified and extended. By means of the altered method we are able to establish threshold functions for a general random intersection graph for such properties as | threshold functions for homogeneous random intersection graphs have to be modified and extended | The coupling method for inhomogeneous random intersection graphs | 0.43 |
| Although the free energy of a genome packing into a virus is dominated by DNA-DNA interactions, ordering of the DNA inside the capsid is elasticity-driven, suggesting general solutions with DNA organized into spool-like domains. Using analytical calculations and computer simulations of a long elastic filament confined to a spherical container, we show that the ground state is not a single spool as assumed hitherto, but an ordering mosaic of multiple homogeneously-ordered domains. At low densities, we observe concentric spools, while at higher densities, other morphologies emerge, which resemble topological links. We discuss our results in the context of metallic wires, viral DNA, and flexible polymers | a long elastic filament confined to a spherical container is confined | Spontaneous Domain Formation in Spherically-Confined Elastic Filaments | 0.52 |
| Learning in multi-agent scenarios is a fruitful research direction, but current approaches still show scalability problems in multiple games with general reward settings and different opponent types. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Malm\\O competition is a new challenge that proposes research in this domain using multiple 3D games. The goal of this contest is to foster research in general agents that can learn across different games and opponent types, proposing a challenge as a milestone in the direction of Artificial General Intelligence | the multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in MalmO competition proposes research in | The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Malm\\O Competition | 0.5 |
| We propose a simple and efficient scheme based on adaptive finite elements over conforming quadtree meshes for collapse plastic analysis of structures. Our main interest in kinematic limit analysis is concerned with both purely cohesive-frictional and cohesive materials. It is shown that the most computational efficiency for collapse plastic problems is to employ an adaptive mesh strategy on quadtree meshes. However, a major difficulty in finite element formulations is the appearance of hanging nodes during adaptive process. This can be resolved by a definition of conforming quadtree meshes in the context of polygonal elements. Piecewise-linear shape functions enhanced with generalized bubble functions in barycentric coordinates are used to approximate the velocity field. Numerical results prove the reliability and benefit of the present approach | kinematic limit analysis is based on adaptive finite elements over conforming quadtre | An adaptive strategy based on conforming quadtree meshes for kinematic limit analysis | 0.71 |
| The magnetic field of a homogeneously magnetized cylindrical tile geometry, i.e. an angular section of a finite hollow cylinder, is found. The field is expressed as the product between a tensor field describing the geometrical part of the problem and a column vector holding the magnetization of the tile. Outside the tile, the tensor is identical to the demagnetization tensor. We find that four components of the tensor | magnetic field of a homogeneously magnetized cylindrical tile geometry is found. the | The magnetic field from a homogeneously magnetized cylindrical tile | 0.67 |

| We propose a new approach leading to giant gain enhancement. It is based on unconventional slow wave resonance associated to a degenerate band edge in the dispersion diagram for a special class of photonic crystals supporting two modes at each frequency. We show that the gain enhancement in a Fabry-Perot cavity when operating at the DBE is several orders of magnitude stronger when compared to a cavity of the same length made of a standard photonic crystal with a regular band edge . The giant gain condition is explained by a significant increase in the photon lifetime and in the local density of states. We have demonstrated the existence of DBE operated special cavities that provide for superior gain conditions for solid-state lasers, quantum cascade lasers, traveling wave tubes, and distributed solid state amplifiers. We also report the possibility to achieve low-threshold lasing in FPC with DBE compared to RBE-based lasers. | new approach leads to giant gain enhancement in a Fabry-Perot cavity | Giant Gain Enhancement in Photonic Crystals with a Degenerate Band Edge | 0.5 |
| We obtain new semiclassical estimates for pseudodifferential operators with low regular symbols. Such symbols appear naturally in a Cauchy Problem related to recent weak solutions to the unstable Muskat problem constructed via convex integration in . In particular, our new estimates reveal the tight relation between the speed of opening of the mixing zone and the regularity of the interphase. | pseudodifferential operators with low regular symbols appear naturally in a Cauchy Problem. | Semiclassical estimates for pseudodifferential operators and the Muskat problem in the unstable regime | 0.51 |
